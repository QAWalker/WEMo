Description: WEMo is a model that quantifies the energetic environment of a given point resulting from wind-generated waves. The model takes as inputs a bathymetry, a shoreline polygon, and wind history data. This packages contains functions to calculate the fetch, determine the effective fetch, grab the bathymetery along a vector ray and then build a wind-wave.
