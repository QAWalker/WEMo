\title{Calculate Effective Fetch for Wind Energy Transfer}
\usage{
effective_fetch(fetch, wind_energy_transfer_degrees = 45)
}
\arguments{
\item{fetch}{An sf object containing fetch data with geometry \code{LINESTRING},
direction, fetch columns, and site identifiers. Must include
columns for direction (in compass degrees), fetch distance, and site ID.}

\item{wind_energy_transfer_degrees}{Numeric. The half-angle (in degrees) of
the wind energy transfer cone. Wind directions within ±this angle from the
target direction contribute to the effective fetch calculation. Default is 45.}
}
\value{
An sf object (LINESTRING) containing effective fetch rays for each
site and direction, with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{direction} - Wind direction in compass degrees (0-360)
\item \code{efetch} - Calculated effective fetch distance
\item Additional columns from original fetch data
\item \code{geometry} - LINESTRING geometry from center to effective fetch endpoint
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the effective fetch (cosine-weighted fetch) from input fetch lines at a site,
by weighting each fetch distance by the cosine of its angular difference from a target direction.
Due to irregular shoreline in coastal waters the simple fetch length in a given
compass direction is not very effective since the width of fetch places a
substantial restriction on the fetch length (USCOE 1977). Therefore, the fetch
is modified by taking the cosine weighted average of all the rays within a
certain sector on either side of the fetch ray defined by angle θ. The cosine
weighted fetch is named as effective fetch.
}
\details{
Effective fetch in \code{WEMo} is calculated by summing the product of fetch length
and cosine of the angle of departure from the ith heading over each of n number
of fetch rays and dividing by the sum of the cosine of all angles.
Effective fetch rays look trimmed down in the figure compared to fetch rays.
This method is based on assumption that wind moving over water surface transfers
energy to the water in the direction of the wind and in all directions within
4/π radians (45°) on either side of the wind direction. (USCOE 1977)

The function processes each site independently and calculates effective fetch
using a cosine-weighted average of all fetch rays within the specified angular
cone around each target direction. The calculation follows:

\deqn{Eff F_{i} = \frac{\sum_{j=-n}^{n} F_j \cos(\theta_j)}{\sum_{j= -n}^{n} \cos(\theta_j)}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \deqn{Eff F_i} Effective fetch for the ith direction fetch ray
\item \deqn{F_j} length for j radiating fetch ray after clipping to shoreline
\item \deqn{\theta_j} angle between the ith fetch ray and the jth ray
\item \deqn{n} number of rays selected by user
}

The function handles directional wrap-around by expanding the direction space
by ±360° to ensure proper calculation near 0°/360° boundary.
}
\section{Site Identification}{

The function automatically detects site identifier columns by looking for:
\itemize{
\item A column named exactly "site"
\item The first column with a name starting with "site"
}
}

\section{Required Columns}{

The input sf object must contain:
\itemize{
\item \code{direction} - Wind direction in compass degrees
\item \code{fetch} Fetch distance values
\item Site identifier column (see Site Identification section)
\item Valid \code{sf} geometry (typically \code{LINESTRING} or \code{POINT})
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage with default 45-degree cone
effective_fetch <- effective_fetch_sf(fetch_data)

# Use narrower energy transfer cone
effective_fetch <- effective_fetch_sf(fetch_data, wind_energy_transfer_degrees = 30)

# Plot results
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(effective_fetch) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = efetch)) +
  facet_wrap(~site)
